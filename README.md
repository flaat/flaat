Welcome! I'm **Flavio**, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Sapienza University of Rome**, working in the **Hercole Lab** under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriele Tolomei](https://gabrieletolomei.netlify.app/)

My research focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)**, with a particular interest in **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Counterfactual Explanations**. I develop methods to make complex machine learning models more transparent, trustworthy, and aligned with human reasoning—especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare, finance, and law.
